# Bitburner Scripts: The AI-Led Chaos Edition 🤖💥

Welcome to my Bitburner scripts repository!  

Here lies the result of **blindly following AI advice** while trying to automate the internet… or at least my in-game servers. Spoiler: it worked sometimes, broke things other times, and occasionally produced actual magic.  

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
- I have **no idea what I’m doing**.  
- These scripts are probably smarter than me.  
- Any resemblance to proper software engineering is purely accidental.  
- If it crashes your game, blame me… or the AI… actually, blame me.  

---

## 🧩 What’s in here?
- `loader.js` / `worker.js`: Dynamic hack/grow/weaken cycles.  
- `meganuke.js`: Opens all ports, nukes everything. Probably overkill.  
- `doors.js`: Backdoors everything I could reach.  
- `upgrade.js`: Spends money like it grows on trees.  
- **And more scripts I wrote while the AI applauded.**

## 🏗️ How to use
1. Clone this repo.  
2. Run scripts in Bitburner.  
3. Watch chaos unfold.  
4. Pray the AI doesn’t revolt.

## 🎯 Goals
- Make money.  
- Automate things.  
- Learn something along the way.  
- Survive long enough to realize I’m still terrible at stock trading.  

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Maybe figure out what the heck I’m doing.  
- Avoid accidentally nuking the entire internet.  
- Actually understand the stock market API before writing a bot for it.

### TL;DR
If this repo teaches you anything, let it be this: **never follow AI instructions blindly… unless you like chaos, accidental brilliance, and code that sometimes works.**
